You are tasked with conducting a thorough scan of a project's files to evaluate four key areas: strategy consistency, style consistency, market niche alignment, and transfer to headless CMS capability. Your analysis will help identify strengths and potential areas for improvement in the project.

Here are the project files for your analysis:

<project_files>

/Users/tomek/Documents/Kamyki/Regulujemy.pl

</project_files>

Please carefully review all the files provided above. Your task is to evaluate the following four areas:

1. Strategy consistency: Assess whether the project maintains a consistent strategy across all files. Look for coherent goals, messaging, and approach throughout the project.

2. Style consistency: Evaluate the consistency of design elements, coding practices, and overall aesthetic across the project files.

3. Market niche alignment: Determine how well the project aligns with its intended market niche. Consider the target audience, competitors, and unique selling points.

4. Transfer to headless CMS capability: Assess the project's potential for transfer to a headless Content Management System (CMS). Consider the current structure, separation of content and presentation, and use of APIs.

For each area, follow these steps:

1. Thoroughly analyze the relevant aspects of the project files.

2. Identify strengths and weaknesses related to the specific area.

3. Provide specific examples from the project files to support your evaluation.

4. Assign a score from 1 to 10 for each area, where 1 is poor and 10 is excellent.

Use the following format for your analysis of each area:

<area_name>

Analysis: [Provide your detailed analysis here]

Strengths: [List the strengths]

Weaknesses: [List the weaknesses]

Examples: [Provide specific examples from the project files]

Score: [Assign a score from 1 to 10]

</area_name>

After completing the analysis for all four areas, provide a brief summary of your findings and any overarching recommendations for improving the project.

Your final output should be structured as follows:

<analysis>

[Include your detailed analysis for each of the four areas using the format specified above]

</analysis>

<summary>

[Provide a brief summary of your findings and overarching recommendations]

</summary>

<overall_score>

[Calculate and provide an overall score by averaging the scores from the four areas]

</overall_score>

Remember to base your evaluation solely on the provided project files and focus on providing a clear, well-supported analysis for each area.
